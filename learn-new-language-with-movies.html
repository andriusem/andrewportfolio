						<h2>Introduction: How I Learned a New Language from the Carpet of my Living Room in front of an Old Tv</h2>
							<p>During my childhood, my trusty old TV and I were virtually inseparable. I would lose track of time, engrossed in a variety of films spanning from action and comedy to drama, sci-fi, horror, and mystery. Little did I know, these marathon viewing sessions were unwittingly paving the way for me to pick up my first foreign language. I can still recall the distinct memory of watching actors in movies deliver their lines in English, only to be followed by a Lithuanian translation mere moments later. The “delay in translation” was due to dubbing. Of course, I still enjoyed every movie I have watched and something that seemed like a small annoyance at the time ended up being the key to learning a new language.</p>
						<h2>Unlock the Secrets of Learning a New Language with Movies and TV Shows</h2>
							<p>Several studies have substantiated the benefits of incorporating films and television series in language education. For example, a study by Vanderplank (2010) revealed that watching TV shows with captions significantly bolstered listening comprehension and speaking abilities in English as a Foreign Language (EFL) students. One participant in Vanderplank's study remarked that following her favorite comedy series helped her better understand English humor and everyday expressions.</p>
							<p>In a similar vein, a study conducted by Zanon (2006) investigated the influence of film subtitles on English listening comprehension and vocabulary development. The study discovered that exposure to subtitles, particularly in English, resulted in marked improvements in both listening comprehension and vocabulary acquisition for language learners. The findings underscore the importance of incorporating subtitled films into language learning curricula, as they can serve as valuable supplementary resources that reinforce auditory and lexical skills in a more engaging and authentic context.</p>
							<p>Another study by Safaei and Shokrpour (2021) found that using movies and TV shows in teaching English as a Foreign Language (EFL) led to significant improvements in vocabulary acquisition and language proficiency. Students in the study shared that watching movies based on their interests helped them learn new words in a fun and engaging way.</p>
							<p>These real-life examples and research findings show that movies and TV shows can provide valuable language exposure and contextual learning opportunities.</p>
						<h2>The Movie Magic: Tips for Maximizing Language Learning through Movies and TV Shows</h2>
						<ol>
							<li><strong>Choose Your Adventure</strong>: Pick movies and TV shows that match your interests and proficiency level. This will keep you engaged and motivated. Start with content suitable for your current language proficiency and gradually progress to more challenging materials.</li>
							<li><strong>Subtitle Savvy</strong>: Use subtitles strategically. Begin with subtitles in your native language, then switch to same-language subtitles as your proficiency improves. Experiment with alternating subtitles to challenge yourself further.</li>
							<li><strong>Be an Active Watcher</strong>: Don't just passively watch. Take notes, repeat phrases, and pause to look up unfamiliar words. This active engagement will reinforce your learning and help you retain new information.</li>
							<li><strong>Bonus Features</strong>: Leverage movie/TV show companion resources like scripts, language-specific discussion forums, or quizzes to enhance your learning experience.</li>
							<li><strong>Consistency is Key</strong>: Establish a regular routine to maintain progress and motivation. Set aside specific times during the week for your movie or TV show-based language learning sessions.</li>
						</ol>
						<h2>Lights, Camera, Action: Recommendations for Language Learners</h2>
						<ol>
							<li><strong>Starting Strong</strong>: Begin with TV shows and movies designed for language learners, such as the curated content on FluentU, which provides an ideal learning environment for beginners.</li>
							<li><strong>Level Up</strong>: Gradually progress to content made for native speakers, including popular movies, TV series, and documentaries, to expose yourself to various vocabulary, accents, and cultural contexts.</li>
							<li><strong>Genre Hopping</strong>: Experiment with different genres to gain a diverse understanding of the language and its many nuances.</li>
						</ol>
						<h2>Conclusion: Embrace the Power of Movies and TV Shows in Your Language Learning Journey</h2>
							<p>Watching Tv shows and movies can be not only entertaining but also expose you to a fun, engaging, and research-backed way to acquiring a foreign language. By including this approach into language learning, you will be learning from authentic material and it won’t even feel like you are studying. Now, what are you waiting for, grab a popcorn, get onto your couch, Netflix and chill - you will thank me later.  </p>
